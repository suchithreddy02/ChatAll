# ChatBuddy
## Introduction
Chat Buddy is a real-time web application that facilitates multiple users to engage in conversations. This report provides an overview of the application's architecture, key features, and technologies used for both the frontend and backend development. The application is designed to allow users to log in, join chat rooms, see a list of active users, send messages, and receive real-time updates.

## FrontEnd Development
The frontend of Chat Buddy is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It consists of two main pages: the login page and the chat page. Here's a detailed overview of the frontend development:

- ### Login Page
  - Users access the application by visiting the login page, where they can enter their credentials.
  - React Router is used for handling routes, ensuring smooth navigation between pages.
  - User authentication is performed, and upon successful login, users are redirected to the chat 
    page.
